# Kinetic thumb rotation

I found out that the original Kinetic hand design might benefit from a thumb position adjustment to improve its opposition to the other fingers and provide a better grip.
This is an attempt at slightly rotating the thumb inwards.
Disclaimer: I haven't printed it yet to confirm if it improves the grip strength.
